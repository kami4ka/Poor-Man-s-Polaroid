# What does it mean?
The project was inspired by [Mitxela's Thermal Paper Polaroid](https://mitxela.com/projects/thermal_paper_polaroid) and it's pretty same functionality device, but with own enclosure and custom button. Only one button with status LED inside as control device, cheap webcam for capturing and cheap thermal printer for printing the result.
